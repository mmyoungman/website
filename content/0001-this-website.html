Goals of this Website -- This Website Part One
20th October 2018

<p>You can find the code for this website, at the time of writing, <a href="https://gitlab.com/mmyoungman/homepage/tree/612851edba44990c5171bd651aed49073b4e3b5e">here</a>.</p>
<p>This post is probably only of interest to myself, but I needed a first post, so this is going to be it.</p>
<p>I created this website with a few goals in mind:</p>

<h3>Minimise dependencies</h3>

<p>So I can learn how things work, and because it's more fun. Creating this website is predomiantly a learning exercise. With a hobby project like this, I can happily sacrifice time and roll my own, if that's what I desire.</p>

<h3>Write posts in a future-proof format</h3>

<p>I want to avoid editing all posts by hand if I need them in a different format in the future.</p>
<p>I've decided to try markdown to start, but I'm already resorting to embedding HTML for some tables and superscript, plus using hacky workarounds for formatting. I'm considering moving to <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, as it's more powerful and should allow me to include additional information like categories, tags, blurbs.</p>

<h3>Allow quick iteration</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload">livereload python library</a> does this job admirably. Interested in how that works...</p>

<h3>Automate where possible</h3>

<p>Manually regenerating and uploading the webiste would be a pain, but thankfully <a href="http://www.gitlab.com">GitLab</a> runs the generate_website.py script whenever I push to the repository and serves all files in the public directory. There may be an alternate solution in git hooks.</p>
<p>In it's current form, there's lots of opportunity for improvement. So I've added a "Part One" to the title, as I expect further development.</p>
