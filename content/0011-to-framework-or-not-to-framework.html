To framework or not to framework? That's the question
20 June 2023

<p>With frameworks, you can hit the ground running. They allow inexperienced programmers who aren't domain experts to produce working solutions to common yet difficult problems. New recruits with prior knowledge of the framework (in theory) become productive quicker. You can feel safe that many others are using the same code, providing assurances around security and scalability; they are tried and tested.</p>

<p>When you first start using a framework, it can feel like it's giving you many things for free. And they do. But there is a cost to be paid, mostly due to the complexity of frameworks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Frameworks make assumptions about what you want to do, limiting the control you have over the solution; the framework features you use won't be perfectly suited to your problem. With some problems, the framework may become a hinderance.</li>
  <li>Frameworks provide features your project won't need, resulting in the complexity dwarfing a custom-designed solution - extra complexity programmers must dig through.</li>
  <li>The size of frameworks makes it practically impossible to fully understand them. A lack of knowledge or a mistaken assumption about how something works will often lead to issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Building from scratch</h3>

<p>Starting from scratch definitely isn't right for every project, but I think the difficulty of doing so is generally overestimated. There is a large upfront cost, but with a good foundation established, I think programmer productivity and the quality of the solution can skyrocket:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The solution is simpler, so new features require less work.</li>
  <li>The solution is specific to your problem, meaning there is less code and complexity to contend with.</li>
  <li>You maintain complete control. There is no need to work around someone else's ill-fitting code.</li>
  <li>You fully understand your solution, since you (and/or your team) implemented it.</li>
  <li>You are forced to fully understand the problem you are tackling.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that said, the early stage of a project will need much more care, is much more make-or-break.</p>

<p>The quality of the foundation will be determined by the skill of your programmers. It requires knowledge of the problem domain you're working in, or the ability to quickly adapt to new problems you're unfamiliar with. It requires research of possible solutions, and then careful selection of the right approach for your project. This is far from trivial.</p>

<p>If that gauntlet is navigated well, the rewards are potentially huge. But if things go wrong, it could be catastrophic, and the failure may not be apparent till sometime later. This risk is probably unacceptable for most companies.</p>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>

<p>My current thinking is that frameworks are the right tool for many projects, particularly those involving large teams of salaried programmers. Although even then, if your team lacks knowledge of the problem domain you're tackling or a deep knowledge of the framework being used, the framework won't prevent complexity from spiraling out of control. However, with a few experts on a team, I think the chances of delivering a working solution are increased dramatically.</p>

<p>For me personally, I have no intention of using frameworks for personal projects. It does increase the difficulty, but I think this is the right decision for programmers who want to be experts at their craft, and want to reap the associated rewards in solution quality and productivity. Frankly, I think frameworks don't cut it if you're attempting to solve ambitious, unique, and interesting problems.</p>

<p>But even if I am wrong, by working from scratch I still gain knowledge of different problem domains, of how to design and architect solutions for those problems, which makes me more effective when using frameworks.</p>

<p>I want to to reliably produce good working solutions without a framework holding my hand. And I think starting from scratch helps someone to learn just that: the consequences of bad practices cannot be ignored. And most importantly, the challenge of building from scratch is much more fun than gluing other people's code together.</p>
