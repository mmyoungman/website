First things first...

Let's see livereload in action.

\section{Will automated testing remove the need for manual testing?}

For the vast majority of cases, no. Unless AIs take over testing, you will need a real human to sit in front of your product/service and test it, regardless of how comprehensiveness your your automated test suite is.

\section{Will automated testing reduce the need for manual testing?}

Yes, but they can present a new set of problems, especially as producing/using an automated framework and writing automated tests is delving into developer territory, and at the time of writing these tasks then to fall on to testers.


\section{What can automated tests do?}

Automated tests can follow a strictly prescribed recipe to the letter. If interpretation or judgement is required to perform a test, then an automated test isn't going to work.

Examples of things that automated tests do badly:

\begin{itemize}
\item Check the UI layout
\item Blah blah fiskcakes
\end{itemize}
