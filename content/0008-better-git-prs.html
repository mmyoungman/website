Better pull requests with interactive rebasing
18 April 2020

<p>I am like most developers in that, rightly or wrongly, the most I pause before creating a pull request is to create a cleanup commit. PRs are often littered with unnecessary commits, and the commits themselves don't intentionally demonstrate the thought process behind the changes made.</p>

<p>There is much scope to improve. In a time when documentation is frequently trumpeted, I'm inclined to think logically grouping, ordering, and labelling the commits made in a PR can probably help more. And as it could be part of a workflow, it may be easier to stick to than an additional task that is easily forgotten like documentation.</p>

<h3>Clear commit messages</h3>

<p>Commit messages are the obvious starting point to improve a PR, but you can only have a good commit message if the commit changes themselves are explicative -- even with no message.</p>

<p>That said, it is the lowest hanging fruit -- particularly if, like me, you have created many-a-commit like</p>

<code>
git commit -m"TKT-999 Fixes the thing"<br/>
</code>

<p>There are already good guides for <a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">writing commit messages</a> -- and interactive rebasing can help reword commit message before creating a PR.</p>

<h3>Beyond the commit message</h3>

<p>There are others ways to improve PRs that aren't often discussed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the grouping of changes made in a PR -- is each step clearly demarcated?</li>
  <li>the order of those changes -- is it logical?</li>
  <li>whether some commits on a PR need to exist at all</li>
</ul>

<p>Interactive rebase can be used to manipulate commits on your branch before creating a PR. A commit that fixes a typo, for example, can be squashed. Consider this example:</p>

<code>
    $ git log<br/>
    commit f001584020e873aa89a3063c29c7f29fcf87317a (HEAD -&gt; master)<br/>
    Author: Mark Youngman<br/>
    Date:   Sat Apr 18 20:04:57 2020 +0100<br/>
    <br/>
    Add even more text to test.txt<br/>
    <br/>
    commit 5ad7fb8c8a632cf36863534104fb1bfb1d27fc59<br/>
    Author: Mark Youngman<br/>
    Date:   Sat Apr 18 20:04:23 2020 +0100<br/>
    <br/>
    Fix typo in test.txt<br/>
    <br/>
    commit 42c9d470c400f4502031dfea23977693b9973023<br/>
    Author: Mark Youngman<br/>
    Date:   Sat Apr 18 20:01:42 2020 +0100<br/>
    <br/>
    Added more text to test.txt<br/>
    <br/>
    commit b3e17ee7b2f605482e67f812ff6fea313a74fd0f<br/>
    Author: Mark Youngman<br/>
    Date:   Sat Apr 18 19:40:04 2020 +0100<br/>
    <br/>
    Added test.txt<br/>
</code>

<p>This can be fixed as follows:</p>

<code>
git rebase -i HEAD~3
</code>

<p>On starting the interactive rebase, instructions are provided:</p>

<code>
    6 # Commands:<br/>
    7 # p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit<br/>
    8 # r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message<br/>
    9 # e, edit &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but stop for amending<br/>
    10 # s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but meld into previous commit<br/>
    11 # f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message<br/>
    12 # x, exec &lt;command&gt; = run command (the rest of the line) using shell<br/>
    13 # b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')<br/>
    14 # d, drop &lt;commit&gt; = remove commit<br/>
    15 # l, label &lt;label&gt; = label current HEAD with a name<br/>
    16 # t, reset &lt;label&gt; = reset HEAD to a label<br/>
    17 # m, merge [-C &lt;commit&gt; | -c &lt;commit&gt;] &lt;label&gt; [# &lt;oneline&gt;]<br/>
    18 # .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's<br/>
    19 # .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was<br/>
    20 # .       specified). Use -c &lt;commit&gt; to reword the commit message.<br/>
    21 #<br/>
    22 # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.<br/><br/>
    23 #<br/>
    24 # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.<br/>
    25 #<br/>
    26 # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.<br/>
</code>

<p>In this instance, you change <code>pick</code> on the relevant commit to <code>f</code> for fixup:</p>

<code>
1 pick 42c9d47 Added more text to test.txt
2 <span style="color:red">f</span> 5ad7fb8 Fix typo in test.txt   
3 pick f001584 Add even more text to test.txt
</code>

<p>In a different situation, evidence of the typo may still exist in your PR. To erase all evidence, you can use <code>rebase -i</code> to amend the appropriate commit:</p>

<code>
    git rebase -i master<br/>
    [replace 'pick' on the appropriate commit with 'e']<br/>
    [fix the typo]<br/>
    git add [file]<br/>
    git commit --amend<br/>
    git rebase --continue<br/>
</code>

<h3>Commits as steps towards a complete feature</h3>

<p>After squashing unnecessary commits, a PR can be further improved by having each commit be a logical step towards the completed feature. This means the PR can be read commit by commit, showing why the feature was developed as it was.</p>

<p>This ordered grouping of changes often isn't the case with PRs. The steps towards the completed feature are spread amongst different commits, so rather than</p>

<code>
    Commit 1: Finish step A<br/>
    Commit 2: Finish step B<br/>
    Commit 3: Finish step C<br/>
    Commit 4: Finish step D<br/>
</code>

<p>you have</p>

<code>
    Commit 1: A little bit of A and C<br/>
    Commit 2: Finish A and start B<br/>
    Commit 3: Finish B and C and D<br/>
</code>

<p>Ideally, making your PRs more like the former than the latter is done by having the discipline to identify the steps before starting work on a feature. Back in the real world, some cleanup will be required before creating your PR.</p>

<p>With <code>rebase -i</code>, this cleanup can largely be done by rewording, squashing, and editing commits. However, in some instances you may want to split a commit.</p>

<h3>Splitting a commit</h3>

<p>Changes across two commits are probably simpler to follow than both combined. For that reason, alongside padding your commit stats, splitting a commit can make sense.
<p>A commit can be split by following these steps:</p>

<code>
    git log<br/>
    [make a note of the hash of the commit you wish to split]<br/>
    git rebase -i master<br/>
    [replace 'pick' to 'e' on the commit immediately _before_ the commit you wish to split]<br/>
    git checkout [commit_hash] -- . # Assuming you're in your project's root dir<br/>
    git restore --staged .<br/>
    [restage the files with the changes you want to appear in the 1st of the two commits]<br/>
    git commit -m"Your commit message" # Note we create a new commit -- not amend!<br/>
    git rebase --continue<br/>
</code>

<p>If you're making such changes before creating a PR, it's probably best to clone your branch before making them, so you can check the two branches for unintentional differences.</p>

<h3>Worth the effort?</h3>

<p>I'm only starting to think about this, and it is uncertain to me whether time spent is worth it. But I can imagine several benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your code (possibly) improves by practicing the above</li>
  <li>Your code is easier to understand and review</li>
  <li>You look professional</li>
</ul>
