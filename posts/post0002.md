First things first...

### Will automated testing remove the need for manual testing?

For the vast majority of cases, no. Unless AIs take over testing, you will need a real human to sit in front of your product/service and test it, regardless of how comprehensiveness your your automated test suite is.

### Will automated testing reduce the need for manual testing?

Yes, but they can present a new set of problems, especially as producing/using an automated framework and writing automated tests is delving into developer territory, and at the time of writing these tasks then to fall on to testers.


### What can automated tests do?

Automated tests can follow a strictly prescribed recipe to the letter. If interpretation or judgement is required to perform a test, then an automated test isn't going to work.

Examples of things that automated tests do badly:

* Check the UI layout
* Blah blah fiskcakes
